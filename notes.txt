PANGENOME NOTES
Larger region high density SNP:
FAM30A (near IGH - immunoglobulin heavy locus)
LINC01671
lnc-SLCO4A1-8
MIR4538 (neah IGH)
SNAR-A1
SNAR-B2 (near other SNARs)
SNAR-C3 (near other SNARs)
SNAR-C4 (near other SNARs)
SNAR-G1 (near CBG)
SNAR-G2 (near CBG)
TRE-TTC5-1
TRG-CCC6-1
TRG-CCC4-1
TRV-CAC5-1



Interesting points:
MIR3689A - high density area only around the MIRNA - pre-miRNA
RCCD1-AS1 - lower density on the gene, higher density around the area (UNC45A, RCCD1)
RNU5D-1 -very high peak in SNP density around the gene itself
RNU5E-1 -very high peak in SNP density around the gene itself, near a pseudogene (RNU5E-4P) also with high SNP density
RNU5F-1 - overlap with ARMH1 but higher density around gene itself
RNU6-1 - doesn't look like a lot of SNP density
SNAR-F - indels? large chunks of SNP density around gene
SNORD118 - overlap with TMEM107 but higher density around gene
TRA-AGC4-1 - very high density near gene - not around anything (other than lncRNA)
TRG-CCC5-1 - high larger area density, but higer around gene
